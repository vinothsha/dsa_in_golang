Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.

Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items.

If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.

Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways which are discussed below.

	1.)Iterative Method
	2.)Recursive Method
	
The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach.

Time Complexities

Best case complexity: O(1)
Average case complexity: O(log n)
Worst case complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity

The space complexity of the binary search is O(1).
